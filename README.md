# MATH_3210_001_SPRING_2025

This is MATH 3210-001, the advanced single variable calculus class at the University of Utah. 

---

This is a proof based class, and the emphasis will be on developing "mathematical maturity", in particular on rigorous argumentation, rather than calculation of the values of certain limits, integrals or derivatives. We’ll start with elementary logic and set theory, discuss
main methods of documentation that are up to the modern standards of mathematical rigor, and then discuss differential and integral calculus of single variable, real valued functions. As adjacent topics we’ll study the convergence and divergence of sequences and series of numbers and functions.
